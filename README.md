# Setup

1. Run `npm install`

2. In VS Code, install the Live Server extension. When installed, you will see an item in the bottom right tray named "Go Live". Click that to start the live server. 
3. NOTE: the live server does not seem to update in the preview window, you should go to the browser and refresh the page to see changes.

4. In terminal, run `npm run watch:scss`. This script will watch for changes to the scss and will rebuild the css automatically upon change.

Enjoy!

Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
